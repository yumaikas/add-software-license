# A janet program to add Software license files in Github frien

Currently it just supports the MIT licsense, and this is a very small project that currently only works fully automatically on Winows. If you want it to work on other platforms, you need to have the AUTHOR env var set when running `spit-mit`.

## Build and install

Run `jpm build` to create the `spit-mit` executable in `/build`, and then copy said exectuable on to your path. 

## Running

Just type `spit-mit` to create a LISCENSE.md file in the current directory
